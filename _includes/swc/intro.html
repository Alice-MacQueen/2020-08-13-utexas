  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on three hour Carpentry lesson will cover basic commands in Git
  for version control and code management and will use Git and GitHub.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another in the <a href="https://pad.carpentries.org/2020-08-13-utexas">collaborative 
  notetaking document</a> and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
